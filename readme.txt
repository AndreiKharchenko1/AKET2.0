This is AKET 2.0, Andrei Kharchenko Eyecolor Tool 2.0
Developed by me. Also check out my Youtube Channel, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_qIzYkWdnJj5YTfVU-Idhg

How AKET2.0 was developed:
 For a long time I have been collecting user data from OpenSNP, and found a relationship
between 21 snps and eyecolor. 
I compared the results of my studies with the statistical data on GWAS Central.
Consider the data used in this project as a merge between the result of my personal study
and GWAS Central. 

The advantages of AKET2.0:
If all the snps are found in your file, you will receive usable Vahaduo coordinates.
This is a fun little project that is NOT meant to be used as an ethnicity estimate.
If you are a Northern European, for example, but you have brown eyes - the ethnicities 
most similar to you on this tool will not be Northern Europeans, it will most likely be MENA.
 
You will receive an eyecolor estimation regardless of whether or not all snps were found in your file.

If you took a Myheritage, or 23andme, most likely all the snps will be found in your file.
If you took Ancestry, it is possible that most snps will be found in your file, and it is possible none will be found.
I've had issues with Ancestry kits in the testing stage of my project.

Instructions on running AKET2.0:
Dowload the AKET2.exe file together with eyes.jpg file, put them in the same fold (important that they are in the same folder)
Paste your DNA file in the same folder.
Run the .exe, and input your DNA file name exactly as it is (so, you put the .txt or the .csv at the end as well)
Enjoy :)
